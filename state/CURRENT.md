# Current Project State

## Milestone

Agent/harness planning and repository foundation.

## Completed

- High-level MLB predictor architecture defined.
- V1 model candidates chosen:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Validation strategies chosen:
  - expanding window,
  - rolling 2-season window,
  - rolling 3-season window,
  - untouched 2026 final holdout.
- Core rule established: all predictive features must be point-in-time safe.
- Vendor-neutral agent workflow defined:
  - Orchestrator,
  - Implementer,
  - Reviewer,
  - Tester.

## In progress

- META-001 — repository/agent foundation.

## Blocked

None.

## Current architecture decisions

- Python is the V1 implementation language.
- DuckDB + Parquet are the V1 storage layer.
- Raw source data is immutable.
- Bronze / Silver / Gold data layers are used.
- MLB `game_pk` is the canonical baseball game identifier.
- Odds data is stored as timestamped snapshots.
- Streamlit is the default lightweight V1 UI.
- The model target is binary home-team win probability.
- Model quality is judged primarily by probability quality, not raw accuracy.
- Betting-style ROI is secondary evaluation.
- Fliff is not part of the core system.

## Next ready tasks

1. META-001 — commit agent/harness files and base repository conventions.
2. DATA-001 — create storage foundation after META-001.

## Notes for the next harness

Do not assume conversational history is available.
